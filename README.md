# Game
In order to win this game, you need to place colored chips in vertical lines.
There are colored indicators in top of the field. They show the color of the line that must be build under it.
Use arrows to move the focus frame around the field. Use shift + arrow to lock focus on chip and move them both.
You can move focus quite anywhere but focus with chip can be moved only to empty slots. There are permanently blocked slots where chips can not be moved to ever.
